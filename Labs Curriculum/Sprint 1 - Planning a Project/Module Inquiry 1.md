# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
We asked and got clarity on what different types of accounts / users needed to be included, what should be done with the user images, and what type of complexity the stakeholder wants us to model.

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
Because the first release canvas doesn't include any of the DS deliverables, we created our own 'tasks' to begin this unit with, including:
- Deploy baseline API
- Retrain Story Analysis Engine
- Create NLP model for story complexity

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
My favorite task is the NLP model for story complexity. The very first thing that we need to do, and are in the process of doing, is clarifying with the stakeholder what he wants to be a part of that, and also how much we can use the previous iteration of Labs to build off of. Then we need to do research into what other models or methods may already exist that we can call on to achieve the specific goals of the stakeholder. We'll probably need to go through a few iterations of trying different methods to find the one that is the best fit, and then we'll need to get it into production before the second release canvas (which will include incorporating the model into our API and providing output to both child and parent accounts as the stakeholder prefers).

    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    - I think our DS team did a good job of talking through our main objectives, and some questions we had arise from it. It feels like we will have good cohesion on our sub-team. Some challenges were realizing that we needed more information from the stakeholder, and also the challenge that we couldn't fully participate in the full group conversation because our objectives aren't included until the second release canvas.

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
I think we did a decent job of approaching this breakdown/planning, although I'm sure the next time around we would be able to be more efficient and on the same page about what we were doing. I'm sure we'll also learn things down that road that will let us know what we could have done differently from the start!
